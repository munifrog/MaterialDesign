## Introduction

Android app that acts as an eReader and domonstrates implementations of various guidelines found
in the [Google Material Design specifications](https://material.io/design/introduction/#principles).

## Overview

The app contains two Activities:
 * A list of articles
 * A display of the article contents

## Getting started / Usage

The files for this project were built using Android Studio, so you will likely have the easiest
time duplicating the original behavior using the same.

1. First, clone this repository
   * `git clone https://github.com/munifrog/MaterialDesign.git`
1. Open the _XYZreader_ directory using Android Studio
1. Launch the app on an emulator or a physical device

## License

This project started as a task within the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)
and Udacity (or Google) owns the rights for the project idea.

While I personally prefer indirect sources for finding solutions to puzzles, you may learn from
what I have done, if that helps. Just be careful to avoid plagiarism if you are also taking this
course and looking for answers.

If, on the other hand, you want to build on what I have done, that is also welcome.
